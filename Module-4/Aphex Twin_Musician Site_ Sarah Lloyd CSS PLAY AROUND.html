 <ol>
   <li> He was born in Ireland as Richard D. James. Fewer know that his adopted name was taken from Aphex Systems Limited, a brand of audio single processing equipment. Twin, he says, is in memory of his older brother who died at birth, who was also named Richard James. </li>
   <li> When he was paid to do a remix of a track by The Lemonheads, he lost track of the time. Submitted was a disk with random beats on it, James claiming he had used one note from the song and sped it up. </li>
   <li> The double album ‘Drukqs’ was released in 2001. He had previously said he would only compose music for his consumption. However, when a laptop with hundreds of tracks was rumored to have been stolen, fearing they would end up on the Internet, he released them. </li>
   <li> James once went five weeks without sleeping. According to him, doing this all your life would make living to be a hundred the equivalent of living to two hundred. He does it to make music. “Your mind starts getting scatty, like you’re going senile” he says. “You start doing unpredictable things, like making tea but pouring it into a cereal bowl.” </li>
   <li>  He makes scores of his favourite films, taking out obtrusive scores and re-soundtracking films like The Shining. </li>
